This spreadsheet was made to track who was vaccinated and who wasn't. This was useful for us during the time that health orders had differing instructions on
how to handle symptomatic cases and close contacts. We would receive a person's information and add it to this spreadsheet. The dashboard auto populates as information
is entered into the data set.
