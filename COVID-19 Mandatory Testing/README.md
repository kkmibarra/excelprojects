This was made when management decided to start conducting mandatory testing. We needed to have a way to track who was taking the test and who wasn't. 
As I received the data from the 3rd party provider, add a new column in the tab called "Sample Employees with formulas", import the tab from the excel 
heet provided by the testing provider, make that data transferable using VLOOKUP which allowed me to give management updated numbers as they requested on 
how many people missed "X" tests. 

I added a pivot table with a graphic interpretation of the data in the pivot table.
