This was created as a way for our cost accounting to provide us a more accurate picture of what was being produced on the machine shop floor. 
When a button is clicked (status changes) the macro copies the data that is being displayed within the machine i.e. info below "R1" or "R2".
How a production job would be would be the following: 
-> Setup so the machinist sets up the machine and we are tracking how long it takes that person to set up the machine. This includes running the first piece.
-> QA the part is taken into Quality Assurance for inspection.
-> Running means the part has passed inspection and the rest of the pieces of material can run.
-> Any other status in red means there is a problem and the machine isn't running
-> The rest of the statuses are there to indicate why a machine may not be running.
