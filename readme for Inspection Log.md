This was created as a way to track time spent in the QA department. Depending on the department dropping off a machined part, they would use the corresponding 
tab to and fill out their respective fields. Once blue fields were filled out, a timestamp would appear and a timer in the elapsed time field would start. This
would indicate how long a part is waiting before someone starts inspection. Once the inspection started by is filled in by a person the first elapsed timer
would stop and the timer next to that field would start. This indicates the person has started to inspect the part. QA can accept or reject, depending on the
option chosen, they would have to fill out more other purple fields before the inspection timer stops. i.e. part is rejected, fill out why, defect code, etc.
Once you scroll to the end, you can see the time inspection started, the time it was done with QA, the total time in QA, and the actual time that we used to
count (the code removed certain times of the day to account for when people weren't working. Conditional formatting is added to timers so people can see, at a glance, if a part is taking more than 1 day to inspect.
